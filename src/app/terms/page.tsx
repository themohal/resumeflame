          or regulatory body in any jurisdiction worldwide. This waiver covers all claims related to
          the service, AI-generated output, payment transactions, refund policy, data handling,
          and any other aspect of your interaction with ResumeFlame. You acknowledge that this
          waiver is a material term of this agreement and that ResumeFlame would not provide the
