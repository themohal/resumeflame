        <p>
          All purchases on ResumeFlame are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong>.
          Due to the digital and AI-generated nature of our service, we do not offer
          refunds, returns, or credits once a payment has been processed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Why No Refunds?</h2>
        <p>
          When you purchase a resume rewrite, our AI immediately processes your resume
          and delivers the result. Because the service is fully delivered at the time of
          purchase, we cannot reverse or undo the transaction.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Before You Purchase</h2>
        <p>
          We encourage you to review the pricing and service description carefully before
          making a purchase. By completing payment, you acknowledge that the service will
          be delivered immediately and that no refunds will be issued.
        </p>
