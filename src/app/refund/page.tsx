        <p>
          All purchases on ResumeFlame are <strong>final and non-refundable under any circumstances</strong>.
          Due to the digital and AI-generated nature of our service, we do not offer
          refunds, returns, chargebacks, or credits once a payment has been processed,
          regardless of the reason.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Why No Refunds?</h2>
        <p>
          When you purchase a resume rewrite, our AI immediately processes your resume
          and delivers the result. The service is fully consumed and delivered at the
          moment of purchase. This digital delivery cannot be reversed, returned, or undone.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6">Before You Purchase</h2>
        <p>
          Please review the pricing, service description, and this refund policy carefully
          before making a purchase. By completing payment, you explicitly acknowledge and
          agree that the service will be delivered immediately and that no refunds will be
          issued under any circumstances, including but not limited to dissatisfaction with
          results, accidental purchases, or change of mind.
        </p>
